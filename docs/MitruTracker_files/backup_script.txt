To set up this solution, we need to install postfix mailutils. In Ubuntu we can do this as follows:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils

A simple implementation is shown in scripts/dbAuto_backup

Cron allows you to schedule this script to run regularly. In order to facilitate this, do as follows:
sudo crontab -e

Then, add the script path to the end of the string
30 22 * * * /home/user/script/mysql_backup.sh

Thereafter, your script will be executed every day at 10:30 PM.
